# JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation


### Automatic Table and Date Search 

* Using a UFO dataset wrote code that appends a table to a web page. It then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting

* Using JavaScript wrote code that by the `date/time` column

### Add Multiple Search Categories

* Edited code to create multiple `input` tags and used JavaScript to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings.

* Search fields now include:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
